Einstein developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).<br/><br/>His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from the theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".</p></section>
